An imperfect micro python library for you to drive ST vl53l0x tof ranging and gesture detection sensor ï¼Œworks fine on raspberry pi pico.
main.py is a demo to show you how to use it.

If there is any copyright problem, please contact me to delete it, sorry for that.
It's not perfect, you can't know whether it's reaching the max detection range,
and I don't know how to improve:( If you got any progress, you are welcomed to fork this project.
